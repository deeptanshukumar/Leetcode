/*
1358. Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters

Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 

Example 2:

Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 

Example 3:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1

 

Constraints:

    3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
    s only consists of a, b or c characters.
